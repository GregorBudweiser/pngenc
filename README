README
======
This is pngenc, a fast png encoder focusing on performance rather than compression.
It features two fast modes: Uncompressed and "Huffman Only" compression. In those 
modes pngenc is about 4-5 times faster than libpng and about 10x faster than libpng's default
compression settings. For natural images the compression ratio of the "Huffman Only" 
compression is 10% worse than that of full Huffman + Dictionary compression.
For synthetic images pngenc's compression ratio may not be optimal (but speed is still there).

Pngenc is written in C and compiles down to ~32KB with default settings.
It is optimized for x86_64 machines but also compiles and runs on arm (e.g. Raspberry PI 2).


COMPILE
=======
To build pngenc just use cmake:

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

BENCHMARKS
==========
Optionally you can build the benchmarking examples. 
You can enable them with a cmake define (requires libpng and a C++ compiler):

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TOOLS=1 ..

JAVA BINDINGS
=============
Optionally you can build a jni-version of pngenc.
You have to specify the path to your jdk in <pngenc_dir>/source/pngenc/CMakeLists.txt

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_JAVA=1 ..
