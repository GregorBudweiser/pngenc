README
======
This is pngenc: A small and fast png encoder. In easily encodes FullHD images @100Hz! 
It is meant as a supplement to other png codecs where encoding performance is critical.

Pngenc features two fast modes: 
 * Uncompressed
 * Compressed (Huffman Only; same as zlib's Z_HUFF_ONLY)

Pngenc is optimized for 64bit multicore machines such as x86_64 and ARM64 but compiles and runs on 32bit platforms just fine. It can be compiled with all major compilers such as gcc, clang and MSVC.


TYPICAL RUNTIMES
================
24bit FullHD @ i7 860, 4C/8T (save to /dev/null):
 * Uncompressed: <5ms (~200Hz)
 * Compressed: <9ms (>100Hz)

COMPILE
=======
To build pngenc just use cmake:

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..


BENCHMARKS
==========
Optionally you can build the benchmarking examples. 
You can enable them with a cmake define (requires libpng and a C++ compiler):

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TOOLS=1 ..

JAVA BINDINGS
=============
Optionally you can build a jni-version of pngenc.
You have to specify the path to your jdk in <pngenc_dir>/source/pngenc/CMakeLists.txt

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_JAVA=1 ..
