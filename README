README
======
This is pngenc, a fast png encoder focusing on performance rather than compression.
It features two fast modes: 
 * Uncompressed
 * "Huffman Only" compression (i.e. no range coding)

In those modes pngenc is about 4-5 times faster than libpng and about 10x faster than libpng's default
compression settings. For natural images the compression ratio of the "Huffman Only" 
compression is 10% worse than that of full Huffman + Dictionary compression.
For synthetic images pngenc's compression ratio may not be optimal (but speed is still there).

Pngenc is written in C and compiles down to ~45KB of code. It is optimized for the x86_64 platform but is not tied to it. 
Pngenc can be compiled with gcc, MinGW and MSVC for both 32 and 64 machines. It also runs on arm (tested on a Raspberry PI).

TYPICAL RUNTIMES
================
24bit FullHD @ i7 860 (save to /dev/null):
 * Uncompressed: 11ms
 * Compressed: 28ms
 
24bit FullHD @ i7 4770 (save to /dev/null):
 * Uncompressed: 8ms
 * Compressed: 19ms

COMPILE
=======
To build pngenc just use cmake:

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

BENCHMARKS
==========
Optionally you can build the benchmarking examples. 
You can enable them with a cmake define (requires libpng and a C++ compiler):

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TOOLS=1 ..

JAVA BINDINGS
=============
Optionally you can build a jni-version of pngenc.
You have to specify the path to your jdk in <pngenc_dir>/source/pngenc/CMakeLists.txt

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_JAVA=1 ..
