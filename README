README
======
This is pngenc: A small and _fast_ png encoder.

It is optimized for 64bit multicore machines such as x86_64 and ARM64 but compiles and runs on 32bit platforms as well.

TYPICAL RUNTIMES
================
Pngenc implements both uncompressed and compressed (Z_HUFF_ONLY) modes.
Runtimes for a FullHD image (1920x1080, 24bit) encoded on an Intel Core i7 860, 4C/8T (save to /dev/null):
 * Uncompressed: ~5ms (libpng: ~12ms)
 * Compressed: ~9ms (libpng: ~85ms)

COMPILE
=======
To build pngenc just use cmake:

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..


BENCHMARKS
==========
Optionally you can build the benchmarking examples. 
You can enable them with a cmake define (requires libpng and a C++ compiler):

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TOOLS=1 ..

JAVA BINDINGS
=============
Optionally you can build a jni-version of pngenc.
You have to specify the path to your jdk in <pngenc_dir>/source/pngenc/CMakeLists.txt

cd /to/pngenc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_JAVA=1 ..
